This is a repository I keep for all my works. They are pretty random and don't have a theme

FRONT END CLOUDS -
A project I worked on while I was on my internship. The project was made in Laravel but these files are only the front end part. The code is some of my earliest work. Its a mess, yes. But its just here to see my early code writting.

FRONT END PRINTS - 
This was a project I was a part of when I attended the student exchange in Portugal. Its the complete Laravel project, it should be working, this commit is really old though.

iTunes Albums - 
Just a test to see how much I can do within one work day. I spent circa 8-9 hours on this and haven't touched the code after that. Its a simple page to list X top albums from iTunes

Data Viz - is a short showcase of different visualizations I made through the Dev Express package
